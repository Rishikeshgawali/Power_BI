# Power_BI

This repository contains Power BI dashboards along with their corresponding datasets. Each dashboard is stored in a separate folder, and the required database or data files used for that dashboard are included in the same folder for easy access and understanding.

## Features

- Power BI dashboards created using real-world datasets
- Each dashboard has its own dedicated folder
- Dataset files included with each dashboard
- Useful for learning, practice, and portfolio building

## Prerequisites

- Power BI Desktop
- Basic understanding of data analysis and visualization
- Supported data formats such as Excel, CSV, or SQL databases

## Usage

1. **Clone the Repository** to your local machine:
   ```bash
   https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name
````

2. **Open Power BI Desktop**

3. **Navigate to the required dashboard folder**

4. **Open the Power BI file (.pbix)** and ensure the dataset file present in the same folder is properly connected

## How it Works

1. Each folder represents a single Power BI dashboard.
2. The folder contains the `.pbix` dashboard file and its corresponding dataset.
3. When the dashboard is opened, Power BI uses the data file present in the same folder.
4. Users can explore visuals, filters, and insights directly in Power BI Desktop.

## Example

Open a dashboard by navigating to its folder and opening the `.pbix` file in Power BI Desktop. The visuals will load using the dataset provided in the same folder.
